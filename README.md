This application is part of Turing's Module 2 curriculum. This project aims to use the Fetch API to send requests for information regarding various users, bookings, and rooms. Come visit the Overlook Lodge, we're all your adventuring needs are meet!

Using information provide to us through a local api, our application would create a website that holds all the past and upcoming booking information, the users personal past and upcoming bookings, and how much they spent over all their stays. Rooms that are available at the cabin are shown based on the date you choose to book your stay. Once you confirm your room, the information, including the date, room number and cost of the room are all saved to your local server, which you can view immediately after bookings the room.
